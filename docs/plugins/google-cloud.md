# Google Cloud plugin  

The Google Cloud plugin exports Firebase Genkit telemetry and logging data to the [Cloud Observability](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) suite.

Note: The Firebase telemetry plugin wraps the Google Cloud plugin and offers all the same functionality and configuration options. All exported telemetry data will be visible in Firebase Genkit Monitoring and Cloud Observability.

To get started, visit the [Getting started guide](../observability/getting-started.md) for installation and configuration instructions.

See the [Authentication and authorization guide](../observability/authentication.md) to authenticate with Google Cloud.

See the [Advanced configuration guide](../observability/advanced-configuration.md) for configuration options.

See the [Telemetry collection](../observability/telemetry-collection.md) for details on which Genkit metrics, traces, and logs collected.
