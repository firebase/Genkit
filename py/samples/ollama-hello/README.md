# Hello Ollama

## Prerequisites

- **Ollama** - a local AI model server, which is used to handle embeddings and generate responses.

### Step 1: Install Ollama

1. Go to the [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/download) to download and install Ollama for your operating system.
2. Once installed, start the Ollama server by running:

```bash
ollama serve

The server will run at http://localhost:11434 by default.

### Step 2: Pull the Required Models

Run the following commands in your terminal to pull these models:
