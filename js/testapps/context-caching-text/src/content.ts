J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings is often erroneously
called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting
of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three
volumes.
The first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, was published
in Great Britain by the London firm George Allen & Unwin
on 29 July 1954; an American edition followed on 21 October
of the same year, published by Houghton Mifflin Company
of Boston. In the production of this first volume, Tolkien
experienced what became for him a continual problem:
printer’s errors and compositor’s mistakes, including wellintentioned ‘corrections’ of his sometimes idiosyncratic
usage. These ‘corrections’ include the altering of dwarves to
dwarfs, elvish to elfish, further to farther, nasturtians to nasturtiums, try and say to try to say and (‘worst of all’ to Tolkien)
elven to elfin. In a work such as The Lord of the Rings,
containing invented languages and delicately constructed
nomenclatures, errors and inconsistencies impede both the
understanding and the appreciation of serious readers – and
Tolkien had many such readers from very early on. Even
before the publication of the third volume, which contained
much hitherto unrevealed information on the invented languages and writing systems, Tolkien received many letters
from readers written in these systems, in addition to numerous enquiries on the finer points of their usage.
The second volume, The Two Towers, was published in
England on 11 November 1954 and in the United States on
21 April 1955. Meanwhile Tolkien worked to keep a promise
he had made in the foreword to volume one: that ‘an index
of names and strange words’ would appear in the third volume. As originally planned, this index would contain much
etymological information on the languages, particularly on
the elven tongues, with a large vocabulary. It proved the chief
xii note on the text
cause of the delay in publishing volume three, which in the
end contained no index at all, only an apology from the
publisher for its absence. For Tolkien had abandoned work
on it after indexing volumes one and two, believing its size
and therefore its cost to be ruinous.
Volume three, The Return of the King, finally appeared in
England on 20 October 1955 and in the United States on
5 January 1956. With the appearance of the third volume,
The Lord of the Rings was published in its entirety, and its
first edition text remained virtually unchanged for a decade.
Tolkien had made a few small corrections, but further errors
entered The Fellowship of the Ring in its December 1954
second impression when the printer, having distributed the
type after the first printing, reset the book without informing
the author or publisher. These include misrepresentations of
the original printed text – that is, words and phrases that
read acceptably in context, but which depart from Tolkien’s
wording as originally written and published.
In 1965, stemming from what then appeared to be copyright problems in the United States, an American paperback
firm published an unauthorized and non-royalty-paying edition of The Lord of the Rings. For this new edition by Ace
Books the text of the narrative was reset, thus introducing
new typographical errors; the appendices, however, were
reproduced photographically from the hardcover edition, and
remain consistent with it.
Tolkien set to work on his first revision of the text so that
a newly revised and authorized edition could successfully
compete on the American market. This first revision of the
text was published in America in paperback by Ballantine
Books, under licence from Houghton Mifflin, in October
1965. In addition to revisions within the text itself, Tolkien
replaced his original foreword with a new one. He was pleased
to remove the original foreword; in his check copy, he
wrote of it: ‘confusing (as it does) real personal matters with
the ‘‘machinery’’ of the Tale, is a serious mistake’. Tolkien
also added an extension to the prologue and an index – not
note on the text xiii
the detailed index of names promised in the first edition,
but, rather, a bald index with only names and page references. Additionally, at this time the appendices were greatly
revised.
Tolkien received his copies of the Ballantine edition in late
January 1966, and in early February he recorded in his diary
that he had ‘worked for some hours on the Appendices in
Ballantine version & found more errors than I at first
expected’. Soon after this he sent a small number of further
revisions to Ballantine for the appendices, including the now
well-known addition of ‘Estella Bolger’ as wife of Meriadoc
in the family trees in Appendix C. Most of these revisions,
which entered variously in the third and fourth impressions
( June and August 1966) of volume three, and which were
not always inserted correctly (thereby causing further confusion in the text), somehow never made it into the main
sequence of revision in the three-volume British hardcover
edition, and for long remained anomalies. Tolkien once
wrote, concerning the revising of The Lord of the Rings, that
perhaps he had failed to keep his notes in order; this errant
branch of revision seems likely to be an example of that
disorder – either in his notes or in the ability of his publishers
to follow them with utmost accuracy.
The revised text first appeared in Great Britain in a threevolume hardcover ‘Second Edition’ from Allen & Unwin on
27 October 1966. But again there were problems. Although
the revisions Tolkien sent to America of the text itself were
available to be utilized in the new British edition, his extensive
revisions to the appendices were lost after being entered into
the Ballantine edition. Allen & Unwin were forced to reset the
appendices using the copy as published in the first Ballantine
edition. This did not include Tolkien’s second, small set of
revisions sent to Ballantine; but, more significantly, it did
include a great number of errors and omissions, many of
which were not discovered until long afterwards. Thus, in
the appendices, a close scrutiny of the first edition text and
of the much later corrected impressions of the second edition
xiv note on the text
is necessary to discern whether any particular change in this
edition is authorial or erroneous.
In America, the revised text appeared in hardcover in the
three-volume edition published by Houghton Mifflin on
27 February 1967. This text was evidently photo-offset from
the 1966 Allen & Unwin three-volume hardcover, and is thus
consistent with it. Aside from the first printing of this second
Houghton Mifflin edition, which has a 1967 date on the title
page, none of the many reprintings is dated. After the initial
printings of this edition, which bore a 1966 copyright notice,
the date of copyright was changed in 1965 to match the
statement in the Ballantine edition. This change has caused
a great deal of confusion for librarians and other researchers
who have tried to sort out the sequence of publication of
these editions.
Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966
further revising the text. In June he learned that any more
revisions were too late for inclusion in the 1966 Allen &
Unwin second edition, and he recorded in his diary: ‘But I
am attempting to complete my work [on the revisions] – I
cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much time has
been wasted in all my work by this constant breaking of
threads.’ This was the last major set of revisions Tolkien
himself made to the text during his lifetime. They were added
to the second impression (1967) of the three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin second edition. The revisions themselves mostly include corrections of nomenclature and
attempts at consistency of usage throughout the three volumes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the
1969 one-volume India paper edition.
J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973. His third son and literary
executor, Christopher Tolkien, sent a large number of further
corrections of misprints, mainly in the appendices and index,
to Allen & Unwin for use in their editions in 1974. Most of
these corrections were typographical, and in line with his
father’s expressed intent in his own check copies.
Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien has sent additional cor-
note on the text xv
rections, as errors have been discovered, to the British publishers of The Lord of the Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin
Hyman, and now HarperCollins), who have tried to be conscientious in the impossible task of maintaining a textual
integrity in whichever editions of The Lord of the Rings they
have published. However, every time the text has been reset
for publication in a new format (e.g. the various paperback
editions published in England in the 1970s and 1980s), huge
numbers of new misprints have crept in, though at times
some of these errors have been observed and corrected in
later printings. Still, throughout these years the three-volume
British hardcover edition has retained the highest textual
integrity.
In the United States, the text of the Ballantine paperback
has remained unchanged for more than three decades after
Tolkien added his few revisions in 1966. The text in all of
the Houghton Mifflin editions remained unchanged from
1967 until 1987, when Houghton Mifflin photo-offset the
then current three-volume British hardcover edition in order
to update the text used in their editions. In those new
reprintings a number of further corrections (overseen by
Christopher Tolkien) were added, and the errant Ballantine
branch of revision (including the ‘Estella Bolger’ addition)
was integrated into the main branch of textual descent. This
method of correction involved a cut-and-paste process with
printed versions of the text. Beginning with the 1987 Houghton Mifflin edition, an earlier version of this ‘Note on the
Text’ (dated October 1986) was added to The Lord of the
Rings. This ‘Note’ has been reworked three times since then
– the version dated April 1993 first appeared in 1994, and
the version dated April 2002 came out later that year. The
present ‘Note’ replaces and supersedes all previous versions.
For the 1994 British edition published by HarperCollins,
the text of The Lord of the Rings was entered into wordprocessing files. This next stage of textual evolution came
about to allow for a greater uniformity of the text in all future
editions, but with it, inevitably, came new wrinkles. Some
xvi note on the text
new misreadings entered into the text, while at the same time
others were fixed. In the worst instance, one line of the ring
inscription in the chapter ‘The Shadow of the Past’ of The
Fellowship of the Ring was simply dropped. Unforeseeable
glitches arose in other editions when the base computerized
text was transferred into page-making or typesetting programs – e.g., in one edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, the
closing two sentences of ‘The Council of Elrond’ simply and
inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches have been very much
the exception, not the rule, and the text has otherwise maintained a consistency and integrity throughout its computerized evolution.
The 1994 edition also contained a number of new corrections (again supervised by Christopher Tolkien), as well as a
reconfigured index of names and page references. The 1994
text was first used in American editions published by Houghton Mifflin in 1999. A small number of further corrections
were added into the 2002 three-volume edition illustrated by
Alan Lee, published by HarperCollins in Great Britain and
Houghton Mifflin in the United States.
The textual history of The Lord of the Rings, merely in its
published form, is a vast and complex web. In this brief
note I have given only a glimpse of the overall sequence and
structure. Further details on the revisions and corrections
made over the years to the published text of The Lord of the
Rings, and a fuller account of its publishing history, may be
found in J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography, by Wayne
G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson
(1993).
For those interested in observing the gradual evolving of
The Lord of the Rings from its earliest drafts to its published
form, I highly recommend Christopher Tolkien’s account,
which appears within five volumes of his twelve-volume series
The History of Middle-earth. Volumes six through nine contain the major part of his study pertaining to The Lord of the
Rings: The Return of the Shadow (1988); The Treason of
note on the text xvii
Isengard (1989); The War of the Ring (1990); and Sauron
Defeated (1992). Also, the final book of the series, The Peoples
of Middle-earth (1996), covers the evolution of the prologue
and appendices to The Lord of the Rings. These volumes
contain an engrossing over-the-shoulder account of the
growth and writing of Tolkien’s masterpiece.
The process of studying Tolkien’s manuscripts of The Lord
of the Rings involved the deciphering of versions where
Tolkien wrote first in pencil and then in ink atop the pencilled
draft. Christopher Tolkien has decribed his father’s method
of composition in The Return of the Shadow: ‘In the handwriting that he used for rapid drafts and sketches, not intended
to endure long before he turned to them again and gave them
a more workable form, letters are so loosely formed that a
word which cannot be deduced or guessed at from the context or from later versions can prove perfectly opaque after
long examination; and if, as he often did, he used a soft pencil
much has now become blurred and faint.’ The true difficulty
of reading such double-drafts can be observed in the frontispiece to The War of the Ring, which reproduces in colour
Tolkien’s illustration of ‘Shelob’s Lair’ from a page of
Tolkien’s manuscript. Looking very closely at the hasty ink
draft alongside the illustration, one can see underneath it the
earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also in The War of the Ring,
Christopher Tolkien reproduces a page from the first manuscript of the chapter ‘The Taming of Sme´agol’, and the
printed text corresponding to this text is on the facing page
(see pp. 90–91). One is astonished at anyone’s ability to
decipher such texts.
That difficulty aside, just what do these books signify to
ordinary readers and to Tolkien scholars? And what is ‘the
history of the writing’ of a book? Simply, these volumes show
in great detail the development of the story of The Lord of
the Rings from its very earliest drafts and hasty projections
through its completion. We see in the earliest materials what
is very much a children’s book, a sequel to The Hobbit, and
as the story grows through various ‘phases’, there is an
xviii note on the text
increase in seriousness and depth. We see alternate branches
of development, the gradual blending and merging of certain
characters, and the slow emergence of the nature of the rings
and of the motivations of other characters. Some of these
various ideas are abandoned altogether, while others are
reworked into some variant form that may or may not survive
into the final version.
One could make a whole catalogue of interesting tidbits
from Christopher Tolkien’s study – such as the fact that
Strider was called Trotter until a very late stage in the writing
of the book; that Trotter was at one time a hobbit, so named
because he wore wooden shoes; that Tolkien at one point
considered a romance between Aragorn and E´ owyn; that
Tolkien wrote an epilogue to the book, tying up loose ends,
but it was dropped before publication (and now appears in
Sauron Defeated); and so on. But these developments are best
appreciated when read within the context of Christopher
Tolkien’s commentary rather than discussed separately.
The most significant achievement of these volumes is that
they show us how Tolkien wrote and thought. Nowhere else
do we see the authorial process itself at work in such detail.
Tolkien’s hastiest comments about where the story might
proceed, or why it can or can’t go such and such a way –
these queries to himself were written out: Tolkien is literally
thinking on paper. This gives an added dimension of understanding to Tolkien’s comment to Stanley Unwin in a 1963
letter that, when suffering from trouble with his shoulder and
right arm, ‘I found not being able to use a pen or pencil as
defeating as the loss of her beak would be to a hen.’ And we,
as readers of these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself
the wonder and bewilderment of new characters appearing
as if from nowhere, or of some other sudden change or development, at the very moment of their emergence into the
story.
I know of no other instance in literature where we have
such a ‘history of the writing’ of a book, told mostly by the
author himself, with all the hesitations and false paths laid
note on the text xix
out before us, sorted out, commented upon, and served up
to a reader like a feast. We are shown innumerable instances
in the minutest detail of the thought-process itself at work.
We see the author fully absorbed in creation for its own sake.
And this is all the more exceptional because this is a history
not only of the unfolding of a story and its text, but of the
evolution of a world. There is an additional wealth of material
beyond simple narrative text. There are maps and illustrations. There are languages and writing systems, and the histories of the peoples who spoke and wrote in these systems.
All of these additional materials add multiple dimensions of
complexity to our appreciation of the invented world itself.
Fifty years into the published life of The Lord of the Rings,
it seems extraordinary to me that we have not only such a
masterful work of literature but also as a companion to it an
unparalleled account of its writing. Our gratitude as readers
goes to both of the Tolkiens, father and son.

NOTE ON THE 50 TH ANNIVERSARY
EDITION
In this edition of The Lord of the Rings, prepared for the
fiftieth anniversary of its publication, between three and four
hundred emendations have been made following an exhaustive review of past editions and printings. The present text
is based on the setting of the HarperCollins three-volume
hardcover edition of 2002, which in turn was a revision of the
HarperCollins reset edition of 1994. As Douglas A. Anderson
comments in the preceding ‘Note on the Text’, each of those
editions was itself corrected, and each also introduced new
errors. At the same time, other errors survived undetected,
among them some five dozen which entered as long ago as
1954, in the resetting of The Fellowship of the Ring published
as its ‘second impression’.
That the printer had quietly reset The Fellowship of the
Ring, and that copies had been issued without proof having
been read by the author, never became known to Tolkien;
while his publisher, Rayner Unwin, learned of it only thirtyeight years after the fact. Tolkien found a few of the unauthorized changes introduced in the second printing when
(probably while preparing the second edition in 1965) he
read a copy of the twelfth impression (1962), but thought
the errors newly made. These, among others, were corrected
in the course of the reprinting. Then in 1992 Eric Thompson,
a reader with a keen eye for typographic detail, noticed small
differences between the first and second impressions of The
Fellowship of the Ring and called them to the attention of the
present editors. About one-sixth of the errors that entered in
the second printing quickly came to light. Many more were
revealed only recently, when Steven M. Frisby used ingenious
optical aids to make a comparison of copies of The Lord of
the Rings in greater detail than was previously accomplished.
note on the 50th anniversary edition xxi
We have gladly made full use of Mr Frisby’s results, which
he has generously shared and discussed.
In the course of its fifty-year history The Lord of the Rings
has had many such readers who have recorded changes made
between its various appearances in print, both to document
what has gone before and to aid in the achievement of an
authoritative text. Errors or possible errors were reported to
the author himself or to his publishers, and information on
the textual history of the work circulated among Tolkien
enthusiasts at least as early as 1966, when Banks Mebane
published his ‘Prolegomena to a Variorum Tolkien’ in the
fanzine Entmoot. Most notably in later years, Douglas A.
Anderson has been in the forefront of efforts to achieve an
accurate text of The Lord of the Rings (and of The Hobbit);
Christina Scull has published ‘A Preliminary Study of Variations in Editions of The Lord of the Rings’ in Beyond Bree
(April and August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond has compiled
extensive lists of textual changes in J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography (1993); and David Bratman has published
an important article, ‘A Corrigenda to The Lord of the Rings’,
in the March 1994 number of The Tolkien Collector. The
observations of Dainis Bisenieks, Yuval Welis, Charles Noad,
and other readers, sent to us directly or posted in public
forums, have also been of service.
Efforts such as these follow the example of the author of
The Lord of the Rings during his lifetime. His concern for the
textual accuracy and coherence of his work is evident from
the many emendations he made in later printings, and from
notes he made for other emendations which for one reason
or another have not previously (or have only partly) been put
into effect. Even late in life, when such labours wearied him,
his feelings were clear. On 30 October 1967 he wrote to Joy
Hill at George Allen & Unwin, concerning a reader’s query
he had received about points in the Appendices to The Lord
of the Rings: ‘Personally I have ceased to bother about these
minor ‘‘discrepancies’’, since if the genealogies and calendars
etc. lack verisimilitude it is in their general excessive accuracy:
xxii note on the 50th anniversary edition
as compared with real annals or genealogies! Anyway the
slips were few, have now mostly been removed, and the discovery of what remain seems an amusing pastime! But errors
in the text are another matter’ (italics ours). In fact Tolkien
had not ‘ceased to bother’, and ‘slips’ were dealt with as
opportunities arose. These, and the indulgence of his publisher, allowed Tolkien a luxury few authors enjoy: multiple
chances not only to correct his text but to improve it, and to
further develop the languages, geography, and peoples of
Middle-earth.
The fiftieth anniversary of The Lord of the Rings seemed an
ideal opportunity to consider the latest (2002) text in light of
information we had gathered in the course of decades of work
in Tolkien studies, with Steve Frisby’s research at hand, and
with an electronic copy of The Lord of the Rings (supplied by
HarperCollins) searchable by keyword or phrase. The latter
especially allowed us to develop lists of words that varied
from one instance to another, and investigate variations in
usage, as they stood in the copy-text and relative to earlier
editions and printings. Of course Tolkien wrote The Lord of
the Rings over so long a period of time, some eighteen years,
that inconsistencies in its text were almost inevitable. Christopher Tolkien even observed to us that some apparent
inconsistencies of form in his father’s work may even have
been deliberate: for instance, although Tolkien carefully distinguished house ‘dwelling’ from House ‘noble family or dynasty’, in two instances he used house in the latter sense but
in lower case, perhaps because a capital letter would have
detracted from the importance of the adjective with which
the word was paired (‘royal house’, ‘golden house’). There
can be no doubt, however, that Tolkien attempted to correct
inconsistency, no less than outright error, whenever it came
to his attention, and it was our opinion, with the advice and
agreement of Christopher Tolkien, that an attempt should be
made to do so in the anniversary edition, in so far as we could
carefully and conservatively distinguish what to emend.
Many of the emendations in the present text are to marks
note on the 50th anniversary edition xxiii
of punctuation, either to correct recent typographical errors
or to repair surviving alterations introduced in the second
printing of The Fellowship of the Ring. In the latter respect
and in every case, Tolkien’s original punctuation is always
more felicitous – subtle points, when one is comparing commas and semi-colons, but no less a part of the author’s
intended expression. Distinctive words such as chill rather
than cold, and glistered rather than glistened, changed by typesetters long ago without authorization, likewise have been
restored. A controlled amount of regularization also seemed
called for, such as naught rather than nought, a change instituted by Tolkien but not carried through in all instances;
Dark Power rather than dark power when the reference is
obviously to Sauron (orMorgoth);Barrow-downs by Tolkien’s
preference rather than Barrowdowns; likewise Bree-hill rather
than Bree Hill; accented and more common Dru´adan rather
than Druadan; capitalized names of seasons when used as
personification or metaphor, according to Tolkien’s predominant practice and the internal logic of the text; and Elvish
rather than elvish when used as a separate adjective, following
a preference Tolkien marked in his copy of the second edition
of The Lord of the Rings. In addition, we have added a second
accent to Nu´meno´rean(s), as Tolkien often wrote the name in
manuscript and as it appears in The Silmarillion and other
posthumous publications.
The result, nonetheless, still includes many variations in
capitalization, punctuation, and other points of style. Not all
of these are erroneous: they include words such as Sun, Moon,
Hobbit, and Man (or sun, moon, hobbit, man), which may
change form according to meaning or application, in relation
to adjacent adjectives, or whether Tolkien intended personification, poetry, or emphasis. His intent cannot be divined
with confidence in every case. But it is possible to discern
Tolkien’s preferences in many instances, from statements he
wrote in his check copies of The Lord of the Rings or from a
close analysis of its text in manuscript, typescript, proof, and
print. Whenever there has been any doubt whatsoever as to
xxiv note on the 50th anniversary edition
the author’s intentions, the text has been allowed to stand.
Most of the demonstrable errors noted by Christopher
Tolkien in The History of Middle-earth also have been corrected, such as the distance from the Brandywine Bridge to
the Ferry (ten miles rather than twenty) and the number of
Merry’s ponies (five rather than six), shadows of earlier
drafts. But those inconsistencies of content, such as Gimli’s
famous (and erroneous) statement in Book III, Chapter 7,
‘Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria’,
which would require rewriting to emend rather than simple
correction, remain unchanged.
So many new emendations to The Lord of the Rings, and
such an extensive review of its text, deserve to be fully documented. Although most readers will be content with the text
alone, many will want to know more about the problems
encountered in preparing this new edition, and their solutions
(where solutions have been possible), especially where the
text has been emended, but also where it has not. To this
end, and to illuminate the work in other respects, we are
preparing a volume of annotations to The Lord of the Rings
for publication in 2005. This will allow us to discuss, at a
length impossible in a prefatory note, the various textual
cruces of The Lord of the Rings, to identify changes that have
been made to the present text, and to remark on significant
alterations to the published work throughout its history. We
will also explain archaic or unusual words and names in The
Lord of the Rings, explore literary and historical influences,
note connections with Tolkien’s other writings, and comment
on differences between its drafts and published form, on
questions of language, and on much else that we hope will
interest readers and enhance their enjoyment of Tolkien’s
masterpiece.

FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION
This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the
Great War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the
yet more ancient history that preceded it. It was begun soon
after The Hobbit was written and before its publication in
1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished first
to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of
the Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some
years. I desired to do this for my own satisfaction, and I had
little hope that other people would be interested in this work,
especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and
was begun in order to provide the necessary background of
‘history’ for Elvish tongues.
When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected
little hope to no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged
by requests from readers for more information concerning
hobbits and their adventures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as
it were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and
middle had been told. The process had begun in the writing
of The Hobbit, in which there were already some references
to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and
the orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of
things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin,
Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery
of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to
the ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.
Those who had asked for more information about hobbits
eventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the
composition of The Lord of the Rings went on at intervals
during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many
duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a
learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was,
xxvi foreword to the second edition
of course, also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by
the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of
Book One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I
found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned,
and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin’s tomb
in Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a
year later when I went on and so came to Lothlo´rien and the
Great River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote the first
drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and the
beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as
the beacons flared in Ano´rien and The´oden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time
for thought.
It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to
report, I forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to
Mordor. These chapters, eventually to become Book Four,
were written and sent out as a serial to my son, Christopher,
then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took
another five years before the tale was brought to its present
end; in that time I changed my house, my chair, and my
college, and the days though less dark were no less laborious.
Then when the ‘end’ had at last been reached the whole story
had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards.
And it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of
professional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my
means.
The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since
it finally appeared in print; and I should like to say something
here with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I
have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a tale-teller
to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the
attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times
maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had
only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving, and
for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who
foreword to the second edition xxvii
have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have
found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause
to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or
of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even
from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story
there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible
in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease
everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that
I have received that the passages or chapters that are to some
a blemish are all by others specially approved. The most
critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor
and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either
to review the book or to write it again, he will pass over these
in silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book
is too short.
As for any inner meaning or ‘message’, it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.
As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and threw
out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled
from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the
link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, ‘The
Shadow of the Past’, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It
was written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet
become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point
the story would have developed along essentially the same
lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things
long before in mind, or in some cases already written, and
little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in
1939 or its sequels.
The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its
process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the
development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would
have been seized and used against Sauron; he would not have
been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-duˆr would not have
been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries
of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his
xxviii foreword to the second edition
own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would
have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge
the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both
sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they
would not long have survived even as slaves.
Other arrangements could be devised according to the
tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference.
But I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and
always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to
detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned,
with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of
readers. I think that many confuse ‘applicability’ with ‘allegory’; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and
the other in the purposed domination of the author.
An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by
his experience, but the ways in which a story-germ uses the
soil of experience are extremely complex, and attempts to
define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is
inadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though naturally
attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the
events of times common to both were necessarily the most
powerful influences. One has indeed personally to come
under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as
the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught
in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to
be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but
one of my close friends were dead. Or to take a less grievous
matter: it has been supposed by some that ‘The Scouring of
the Shire’ reflects the situation in England at the time when
I was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of
the plot, foreseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of Saruman as developed in the story
without, need I say, any allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some
basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was entirely different), and much further back. The
foreword to the second edition xxix
country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily
destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were
rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building
suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the
last decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool
that long ago seemed to me so important. I never liked the
looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had
a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.
The Lord of the Rings is now issued in a new edition, and
the opportunity has been taken of revising it. A number of
errors and inconsistencies that still remained in the text have
been corrected, and an attempt has been made to provide
information on a few points which attentive readers have
raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries,
and if some seem to have been passed over that may be
because I have failed to keep my notes in order; but many
enquiries could only be answered by additional appendices,
or indeed by the production of an accessory volume containing much of the material that I did not include in the original
edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In
the meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition
to the Prologue, some notes, and an index of the names of
persons and places. This index is in intention complete in
items but not in references, since for the present purpose it
has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index,
making full use of the material prepared for me by Mrs. N.
Smith, belongs rather to the accessory volume.

PROLOGUE
1
Concerning Hobbits
This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its
pages a reader may discover much of their character and a
little of their history. Further information will also be found
in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has
already been published, under the title of The Hobbit. That
story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,
composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become
famous in the world at large, and called by him There and
Back Again, since they told of his journey into the East and
his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits
in the great events of that Age that are here related.
Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess
the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and
the first adventure is briefly recalled.
Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and wellfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not
and did not understand or like machines more complicated
than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though
they were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they
were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and
now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to
find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though
they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they
are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They
2 prologue
possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and
silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come
blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men
it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied
magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to
a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close
friendship with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger
and clumsier races.
For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout
and stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much
shorter. Their height is variable, ranging between two and
four feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet;
but they have dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they
were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took
(Bullroarer), son of Isumbras the Third, was four foot five
and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit
records only by two famous characters of old; but that curious
matter is dealt with in this book.
As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are
concerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they
were a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being
notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore
shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad
in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which
was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised
among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful
fingers and could make many other useful and comely things.
Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to
laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and
eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests
at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get
them). They were hospitable and delighted in parties, and in
presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.
It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits
are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than
Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their
prologue 3
own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as
Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer
be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the
Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves
still preserve any records of that vanished time, and their
traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived
quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk
became even aware of them. And the world being after all
full of strange creatures beyond count, these little people
seemed of very little importance. But in the days of Bilbo,
and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of
their own, both important and renowned, and troubled the
counsels of the Wise and the Great.
Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long
past, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the
regions in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same
as those in which they still linger: the North-West of the Old
World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the Hobbits
in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning
(other than genealogical lore) was far from general among
them, but there remained still a few in the older families who
studied their own books, and even gathered reports of old
times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their
own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and
their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than
their Wandering Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these
legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and
customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in the distant
past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a
time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between
the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains.
Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of
the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their own
accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of
4 prologue
a shadow that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened
and its new name was Mirkwood.
Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had
already become divided into three somewhat different breeds:
Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner
of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and
bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; and they
preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader,
heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger; and they
preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer
of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer
than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.
The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient
times, and long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They
moved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as
Weathertop while the others were still in Wilderland. They
were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit,
and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to
settle in one place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit
of living in tunnels and holes.
The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River
Anduin, and were less shy of Men. They came west after the
Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad
and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again.
The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly
branch. They were more friendly with Elves than the other
Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than
in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling.
They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came
down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with
the other kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat
bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as
leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even
in Bilbo’s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be
noted among the greater families, such as the Tooks and the
Masters of Buckland.
prologue 5
In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains
and the Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and
Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Du´nedain, the
kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but
they were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room
and to spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began
to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo’s
time; but one of the first to become important still endured,
though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood
that lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.
It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits
learned their letters and began to write after the manner of
the Du´nedain, who had in their turn long before learned the
art from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever after the
Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was
current through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to
Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to
Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well as their
own names of months and days, and a great store of personal
names out of the past.
About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes
history with a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the Third Age that the
Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree;
and having obtained permission from the high king at
Fornost,* they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a
great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of
Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of
the North Kingdom, and they took all the land beyond to
dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was
* As the records of Gondor relate this was Argeleb II, the twentieth
of the Northern line, which came to an end with Arvedui three hundred
years later.
6 prologue
demanded of them was that they should keep the Great
Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the
king’s messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.
Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing
of the Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became
Year One of the Shire, and all later dates were reckoned from
it.* At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new
land, and they remained there, and soon passed once more
out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still
a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact,
ruled by their own chieftains and meddled not at all with
events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornost with
the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid
of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men
record it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and
then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they chose
from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the authority of the
king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were
little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied
after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long
Winter and the famine that followed it. Many thousands then
perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158–60) were at the time
of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become
accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and
though it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had
before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many
farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.
Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the
Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the northern moors to
the marshes in the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire,
as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a district
of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant corner of
the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and
* Thus, the years of the Third Age in the reckoning of the Elves and
the Du´nedain may be found by adding 1600 to the dates of Shirereckoning.
prologue 7
they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things
moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were
the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk.
They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of
the Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible
the long peace of the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but
they had ceased to remember it.
At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they
had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had,
of course, been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves
in a hard world; but in Bilbo’s time that was very ancient
history. The last battle, before this story opens, and indeed
the only one that had ever been fought within the borders
of the Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of
Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an
invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had grown milder, and
the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in
bitter white winters were now only a grandfather’s tale. So,
though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire,
these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths or
on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving.
The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits
had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away,
they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become
rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that
passed from hand to hand were of that sort.
Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or
to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good
things not least because they could, when put to it, do without
them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or
weather in a way that astonished those who did not know
them well and looked no further than their bellies and their
well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing
nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need
could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they
were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and
8 prologue
arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get
quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.
All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or
so they believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at
home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to
adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo’s
days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the poorest Hobbits
that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living
in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed,
with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still
constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings
of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels
(or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to be
found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits,
as they multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even
in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Hobbiton
or Tuckborough, or in the chief township of the Shire, Michel
Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses
of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by
millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that
sort; for even when they had holes to live in, Hobbits had
long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.
The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to
have begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by
the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore
dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to
be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown
by the down that many grew on their chins. No Harfoot or
Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the
Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire
up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar names
and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire.
It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts
beside, was derived from the Du´nedain. But the Hobbits may
have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in
prologue 9
their youth. For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet
forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that time at the
Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within
reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were
still to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western
marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest
was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The
Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea
from the top of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been
known to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or
sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to
report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats
with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim.
And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and
less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful
of those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a
word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they
turned their faces away from the hills in the west.
The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men,
but the Hobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not
go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and
comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than
built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or
roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That
stage, however, belonged to the early days of the Shire, and
hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by
devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by themselves.
A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was
the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.
The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large,
and inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins
were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many
other ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or the
Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives
lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and
many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case,
10 prologue
clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care.
They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable
branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember
who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be
impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that included
even the more important members of the more important
families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical
trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small
book in themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them
exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were
accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that they
already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.
2
Concerning Pipe-weed
There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that
must be mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or
inhaled, through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the
burning leaves of a herb, which they called pipe-weed or leaf,
a variety probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery
surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or ‘art’ as the
Hobbits preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about
it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck
(later Master of Buckland), and since he and the tobacco of
the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his
remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may
be quoted.
‘This,’ he says, ‘is the one art that we can certainly claim
to be our own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke
is not known, all the legends and family histories take it for
granted; for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some
fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold
Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew
the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the
Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best
prologue 11
home-grown still comes from that district, especially the
varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and
Southern Star.
‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to
his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs,
but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went
often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from
the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned
of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on
the south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have
been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim,
of course, to have done everything before the people of the
Shire, whom they refer to as ‘‘colonists’’; but in this case their
claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from
Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in
the recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk,
Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro
through that ancient road-meeting. The home and centre of
the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing
Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from
time beyond record.
‘All the same, observations that I have made on my own
many journeys south have convinced me that the weed itself
is not native to our parts of the world, but came northward
from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I suspect, originally
brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the
North, where it is never found wild, and flourishes only in
warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor
call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only for the fragrance of its
flowers. From that land it must have been carried up the
Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of
Elendil and our own days. But even the Du´nedain of Gondor
allow us this credit: Hobbits first put it into pipes. Not even
the Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one
Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became as
skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.’
12 prologue

Of the Ordering of the Shire
The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings
already referred to, North, South, East, and West; and these
again each into a number of folklands, which still bore the
names of some of the old leading families, although by the
time of this history these names were no longer found only
in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the
Tookland, but that was not true of many other families, such
as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were
the East and West Marches: the Buckland (p. 129); and the
Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.
The Shire at this time had hardly any ‘government’.
Families for the most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time. In
other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy,
but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged for
generations.
There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it,
away north of the Shire. But there had been no king for nearly
a thousand years, and even the ruins of Kings’ Norbury were
covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild folk and
wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the
king. For they attributed to the king of old all their essential
laws; and usually they kept the laws of free will, because they
were The Rules (as they said), both ancient and just.
It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent;
for the office of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne
that title ever since. The Thain was the master of the Shiremoot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-inarms; but as muster and moot were only held in times of
emergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had
ceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family
prologue 13
was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained
both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to
produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar
habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than
generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, of
referring to the head of the family as The Took, and of
adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim
the Second, for instance.
The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor
of Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every
seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe,
that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was
to preside at banquets, given on the Shire-holidays, which
occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of Postmaster
and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he
managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These
were the only Shire-services, and the Messengers were the
most numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no
means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were wrote
constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their
relations) who lived further off than an afternoon’s walk.
The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their
police, or the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They
had, of course, no uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice
rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the
strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire
only twelve of them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work.
A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed to ‘beat
the bounds’, and to see that Outsiders of any kind, great or
small, did not make themselves a nuisance.
At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they
were called, had been greatly increased. There were many
reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures
prowling about the borders, or over them: the first sign that
all was not quite as it should be, and always had been except
14 prologue
in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and
not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty
years had passed since he set out on his memorable journey,
and he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred
as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the
considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or
how little he revealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite ‘nephew’. And he still kept secret the ring that he had
found.

Of the Finding of the Ring
As is told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo’s door the
great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with
him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them
he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning of
April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest
of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the
Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East. The
quest was successful, and the Dragon that guarded the hoard
was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle of
Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many
deeds of renown were done, the matter would scarcely have
concerned later history, or earned more than a note in
the long annals of the Third Age, but for an ‘accident’ by the
way. The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the
Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it
happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orcmines deep under the mountains, and there, as he groped in
vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor
of a tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere
luck.
Trying to find his way out, Bilbo went on down to the
roots of the mountains, until he could go no further. At the
prologue 15
bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and
on an island of rock in the water lived Gollum. He was a
loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his
large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching
blind fish with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate
any living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it
without a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had
come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a
ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one
thing he loved, his ‘Precious’, and he talked to it, even when
it was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on
his island, except when he was hunting or spying on the orcs
of the mines.
Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring
had been on him when they met; but it was not, and the
hobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as
a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the
Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo
could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if
Bilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished: he
would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.
Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could
neither go on nor back, Bilbo accepted the challenge; and
they asked one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won
the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he
was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his
hand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten:
What have I got in my pocket? This Gollum failed to answer,
though he demanded three guesses.
The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question
was a mere ‘question’ and not a ‘riddle’ according to the strict
rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and
trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his
promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for the
thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove
false, even though such promises were held sacred, and of
old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But
16 prologue
after ages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and
treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to his
island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark
water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now,
and angry, and once his ‘Precious’ was with him he would
not fear any weapon at all.
But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was
gone. His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo’s back, though he
did not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had
at last leaped to a guess, too late. What has it got in its
pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a green
flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his
‘Precious’. Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly
up the passage away from the water; and once more he was
saved by his luck. For as he ran he put his hand in his pocket,
and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that
Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to guard
the way out, lest the ‘thief’ should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself
about his ‘Precious’; from which talk at last even Bilbo
guessed the truth, and hope came to him in the darkness: he
himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape
from the orcs and from Gollum.
At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening
that led to the lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side
of the mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling
and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his
sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring, in
which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill
the wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering
his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled
away down the passage, pursued by his enemy’s cries of hate
and despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!
Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo
first told it to his companions. To them his account was that
Gollum had promised to give him a present, if he won the
prologue 17
game; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he
found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been
given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this
was the very ring that he had found, and as he had won the
game, it was already his by right. But being in a tight place,
he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the
way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo
set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered
it himself, not even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it
still appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several of
the copies and abstracts. But many copies contain the true
account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by
Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though
they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually
written by the old hobbit himself.
Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon
as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the
ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much
questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but
the wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he
did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and
disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the
truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a
‘present’ was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It
was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk
that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his
‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought
strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth
in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this
book.
Of Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here.
With the help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at
the gate and rejoined his companions. He used the ring many
times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he
kept it secret from them as long as he could. After his return
to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf
18 note on the shire records
and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence,
or so he believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of
his Journey that he was writing.
His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his
coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the
Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving
Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End
the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels;
and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his
pocket.
He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in
his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable
occurred in the Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for the celebration of his hundred-and-eleventh
birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History begins.
note on the shire records
At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits
in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the
Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected and
written down. The greater families were also concerned with
events in the Kingdom at large, and many of their members
studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of the
first century of the Fourth Age there were already to be found
in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical
books and records.
The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of
the end of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book
of Westmarch. That most important source for the history
of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long
preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns,
note on the shire records 19
Wardens of the Westmarch.* It was in origin Bilbo’s private
diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it
back to the Shire, together with many loose leaves of notes,
and during S.R. 1420–1 he nearly filled its pages with his
account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it,
probably in a single red case, were the three large volumes,
bound in red leather, that Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift.
To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a
fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other
matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.
The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many
copies were made, especially of the first volume, for the use
of the descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The
most important copy, however, has a different history. It was
kept at Great Smials, but it was written in Gondor, probably
at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended
this note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this work in IV
172. It is an exact copy in all details of the Thain’s Book in
Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of
King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and was
brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to
Gondor in IV 64.
The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red
Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost. In
Minas Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish
languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated version
of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie
outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have
been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir,
some time after the passing of the King. But the chief importance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains the whole of
Bilbo’s ‘Translations from the Elvish’. These three volumes

20 note on the shire records
were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which,
between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available
to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they
were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned
with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.
Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their
great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions
with Rohan and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and
Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red
Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with
Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were
composed or begun by Meriadoc himself, though in the Shire
he was chiefly remembered for his Herblore of the Shire, and
for his Reckoning of Years in which he discussed the relation
of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell,
Gondor, and Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old
Words and Names in the Shire, showing special interest in
discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim
of such ‘shire-words’ as mathom and old elements in place
names.
At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shirefolk, though more important for larger history. None of them
was written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected
many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly
copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to Elendil
and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for the history of Nu´menor and the arising of
Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that The Tale of
Years* was put together, with the assistance of material
collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often
conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and
information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once.
There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained,

together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that
Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel;
but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the
Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of
the Elder Days in Middle-earth.

Chapter 1
A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with
a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and
excitement in Hobbiton.
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the
wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable
disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had
brought back from his travels had now become a local legend,
and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might
say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with
treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also
his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it
seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was
much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call
him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the
mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought
this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that
anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well
as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and
trouble will come of it!’
But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was
generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained
on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the
Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers
among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he
had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began
to grow up.
28 the fellowship of the ring
The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo
Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as
his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of
the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo
happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You
had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo
one day; ‘and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties
comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was still in his
tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties
between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.
Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had
given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but
now it was understood that something quite exceptional
was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be
eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only
reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an
important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.
Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and
rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The
history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once
again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.
No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham
Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at
The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke
with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag
End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same
job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and
stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very
friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill
itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.
‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve
always said,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo
was very polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and
a long-expected party 29
consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables –
in the matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was
recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself ).
‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old
Noakes of Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than
half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins
of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in
Buckland, where folks are so queer.’
‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot
(the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong
side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest.
That’s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.’
‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer
breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big
river – and that isn’t natural. Small wonder that trouble came
of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a
young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like
Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was
a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo
Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was
drownded.’
‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and
other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a
passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it
again.
‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo,
he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr.
Bilbo’s first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being
the youngest of the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo
was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second
cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you
follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with
his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did
after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old
Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out
30 the fellowship of the ring
boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were
drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’
‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the
moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as
sunk the boat.’
‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after
him,’ said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.
‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the
Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call
to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky
enough for those that sit still without looking further for the
cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an
orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer
Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A
regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never
had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place.
Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the
lad back to live among decent folk.
‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those SackvilleBagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End,
that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And
then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on
living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him!
And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers
made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see
the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’
‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear
tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel
Delving in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of
tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by
what I’ve heard.’
‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered
the Gaffer. ‘I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with
his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no
tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter
of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come
prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), but he
a long-expected party 31
had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was
on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill
with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests.
I don’t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked
up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they
say; but there wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam
will know more about that. He’s in and out of Bag End.
Crazy about stories of the old days, he is, and he listens to
all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters –
meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come
of it.
‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are
better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business
of your betters, or you’ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to
him. And I might say it to others,’ he added with a look at
the stranger and the miller.
But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend
of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of
the younger generation of hobbits.
‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he
brought at first,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion.
‘He’s often away from home. And look at the outlandish folk
that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering
conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer,
but Bag End’s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.’
‘And you can say what you like, about what you know no
more of than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted
the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. ‘If that’s
being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in
these parts. There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a
pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden
walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says
that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, and there’s
going to be presents, mark you, presents for all – this very
month as is.’
***
32 the fellowship of the ring
That very month was September, and as fine as you could
ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the
knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going
to be fireworks – fireworks, what is more, such as had not
been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since
the Old Took died.
Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking
waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The
startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It
was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained
at Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a
cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all
alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and
a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows
that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbitchildren ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up
the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed.
At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload: there
were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each
labelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .
That was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and the old man
was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due
mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real
business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the
Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one
of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement of
the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the
old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only
appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long;
but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had
seen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to a
legendary past.
When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves,
had finished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but
a long-expected party 33
not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.
‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when
the time comes.’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and
the door was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in
vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of
the party would never come.
Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open
window of a small room looking out west on to the garden.
The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers
glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers, and
nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at
the round windows.
‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.
‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all
the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’
‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’
‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t
changed it.’
‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your
plan – your whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out
for the best, for you, and for all of us.’
‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday,
and have my little joke.’
‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head.
‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.
The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more
carts. There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing
locally’, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag
End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that
could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in
the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they
began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched
eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.
Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the
34 the fellowship of the ring
Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater postoffice was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen
were called for. There was a constant stream of them going
up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank
you, I shall certainly come.
A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance except on party business. Even those who had,
or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed
inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off
answers, packing up presents, and making some private
preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf’s arrival
he remained hidden from view.
One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south
of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents
and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank
leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate
were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,
adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally
envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work
in his garden.
The tents began to go up. There was a specially large
pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right
inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of
the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches.
More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous
open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field.
A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for
miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to
its height.
Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday
the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday,
September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the
clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.
Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety
of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living
near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident,
a long-expected party 35
but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many
people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and
there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met
the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person.
He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were
those who went out again by a back way and came in again
by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their
own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not
so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system.
Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was
somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had
a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But
they never got tired of them.
On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The
hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost
forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they
had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before,
and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale,
and were of real dwarf-make.
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally
inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and,
of course, food and drink. There were three official meals:
lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were
marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests
were sitting down and eating together. At other times there
were merely lots of people eating and drinking – continuously
from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought
by him, but designed and made by him; and the special
effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by
him. But there was also a generous distribution of squibs,
crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elffountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all
superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing
with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark
36 the fellowship of the ring
smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a
moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers
down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet
scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There
were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees;
there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into
eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there
was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there
was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air
with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into
the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there
was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled
the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went
out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain
seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It
spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden
dragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his
jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed
three times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked,
and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an
express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater
with a deafening explosion.
‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and
alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to
their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for
everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family
dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the
tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number
also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was
not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were
selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were
related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends
(such as Gandalf ). Many young hobbits were included, and
present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going
with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially
when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing
up young hobbits took a lot of provender.
a long-expected party 37
There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many
Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs
(connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of
Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies,
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very
distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly ever
been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of
the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho
and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and
detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card,
written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to
refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in
food for many years and his table had a high reputation.
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech
of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits
of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or
two, would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious
journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very
pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich,
abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions
fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing
weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most
of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that
did not matter much.
After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of
the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that
delightful stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’.
They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their
favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were
prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.
My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear!
Hear! Hear!’ they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus,
seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his
place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated
tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the
38 the fellowship of the ring
golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They
could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the
other was in his trouser-pocket.
My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my
dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and
Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. ‘Proudfeet!’ shouted an
elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of
course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large,
exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.
Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses
that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred
and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly.
This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and
horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There
were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them
bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to
most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous
crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect
make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of
the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo
to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a
merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot
Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands
began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather
vigorous.
But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster
nearby, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall
not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I
have called you all together for a Purpose. Something in the
way that he said this made an impression. There was almost
a long-expected party 39
silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.
Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am
immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too
short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.
Tremendous outburst of approval.
I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I
like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was
unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered
clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and
see if it came to a compliment.
Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should
say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my
heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance
today. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some
loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from the
juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered
what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.
Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers
were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use
the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the
guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted,
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required
number, like goods in a package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar
expression.’
It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the
anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long
Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory
on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not
seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however,
though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only
say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank
you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.
They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop
talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing
or recite. He paused for a moment.
Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an
40 the fellowship of the ring
ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly and
suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret to
announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too
short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I am going.
I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!
He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash
of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their
eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and fortyfour flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo
Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped.
Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several
deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck,
Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse,
Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste,
and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of
shock and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was
probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with
a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For
the moment most of them took it for granted that his
disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor
an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his
daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this,
my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old
fool. But why worry? He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’
He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For
some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and
ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke,
of course, even though he had been in the know. He had
difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise
of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled:
he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most
of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing
Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-
a long-expected party 41
Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want
to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for
more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own
glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the
pavilion.
As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech,
he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic
ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped
down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by
any hobbit in Hobbiton again.
He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment
listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the
sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he
went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped
in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it
away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments,
and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he
hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard.
From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took
out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if
they were very precious, but they were so patched and
weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be
guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too
large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large
strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a
leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope.
The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag
that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then
sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the
mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his
pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came
quickly in.
‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’
‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting
down in a chair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few
42 the fellowship of the ring
final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off
splendidly and according to plan?’
‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising:
it quite startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of
your own, I suppose?’
‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years,
and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something
else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’
‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’
‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure
about this whole affair. It has now come to the final point.
You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of
your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk
about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going
any further?’
‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as
I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t
expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have
made all arrangements.
‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning
to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he
snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know
what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much
bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or something.’
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does
not seem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe
your plan is probably the best.’
‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf – mountains; and then find somewhere
where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives
prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging
on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my
book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived
happily ever after to the end of his days.’
Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope he will. But nobody will read the
book, however it ends.’
a long-expected party 43
‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some
already, as far as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo,
won’t you?’
‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’
‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact
he offered to once, just before the party. But he does not
really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before
I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the
Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be
comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course,
except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he
gets used to being on his own. It’s time he was his own master
now.’
‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed
to that, you remember.’
‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.
‘Where is it?’
‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently.
‘There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my
pocket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly
to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay
there?’
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a
gleam in his eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should
leave it behind. Don’t you want to?’
‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting
with it at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should.
Why do you want me to?’ he asked, and a curious change
came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you
have never bothered me about the other things that I got on
my journey.’
‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the
truth. It was important. Magic rings are – well, magical; and
they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in
your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know
where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have
44 the fellowship of the ring
had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more, Bilbo,
unless I am quite mistaken.’
Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His
kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what
business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my
own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’
‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you.
My own. My Precious. Yes, my Precious.’
The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and
indeed alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ he said, ‘but
not by you.’
‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the
same once. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I
say.’
Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if
you do, Bilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every
word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!
And then you can go yourself, and be free.’
‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.
‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long
life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come!
Do as you promised: give it up!’
‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo.
‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell
you.’ His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.
Gandalf’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry
soon,’ he said. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will
see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the
hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow
filled the little room.
Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand
clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one
another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes
remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and
he began to tremble.
a long-expected party 45
‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said.
‘You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It
is mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me,
if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’
‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I
am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help
you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.’ He turned
away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again
to an old grey man, bent and troubled.
Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ he said.
‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not
to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on
my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye
looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and
disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and
pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found
I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why.
And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’
‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go
away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo,
and I will look after him.’
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently
he sighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he
shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all
that’s what this party business was all about, really: to give
away lots of birthday-presents, and somehow make it easier
to give it away at the same time. It hasn’t made it any easier
in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations.
It would quite spoil the joke.’
‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the
affair,’ said Gandalf.
‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’
He drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting,
or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I
couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ He picked up his bag
and moved to the door.
‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.
46 the fellowship of the ring
‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other
documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me.
That will be safest.’
‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the
mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I
shall wait for him.’
Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set
it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on
the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed
swiftly over the hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to
a look of relief and a laugh.
‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off!’
They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick
from the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out
of different rooms where they had been busy.
‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and
labelled?’
‘Everything,’ they answered.
‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.
It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars.
He looked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off
again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have
really been longing for, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking
at his old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’
‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself!
You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’
‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am
as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great
deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at
last,’ he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he
sang softly in the dark:
The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
a long-expected party 47
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.
He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word
he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and
tents, and followed by his three companions went round
into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He
jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took
to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind
in the grass.
Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the
darkness. ‘Good-bye, my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ he said softly and went back indoors.
Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in
the dark, deep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.
‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’
‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only
a joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really
meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I
wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.’
‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’
said Gandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right – now.
He left a packet for you. There it is!’
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced
at it, but did not open it.
‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I
think,’ said the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now.
And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’
‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder
why. Still, it may be useful.’
‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make
use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe!
Now I am going to bed.’
***
48 the fellowship of the ring
As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say
good-bye to the guests. Rumours of strange events had by
now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say no
doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one
they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits.
Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.
Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather
later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders)
to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and
the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns,
and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and
cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a
number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses,
and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that
lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the bestfed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag
End, uninvited but not unexpected.
Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather
tired and worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had
not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries
was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as
I know, for good.’ Some of the visitors he invited to come
inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for them.
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of
packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every
item there was a label tied. There were several labels of this
sort:
For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on
an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket.
Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written
reams of good advice for more than half a century.
a long-expected party 49
For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.;
on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.
For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex
mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor; on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower
of books, and worse than usual at returning them.
For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT;
on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had
acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on
his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she
arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she
also took the spoons.
This is only a small selection of the assembled presents.
Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in
the course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes
to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many
birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course,
that the birthday-presents were always new; there were one
or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all
around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents,
and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being
cleared a little.
Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written
out personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some
joke. But, of course, most of the things were given where
they would be wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and
especially those of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer
Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen
waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old
Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen
bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by
Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a
capital fellow after the first bottle.
50 the fellowship of the ring
There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of
course, all the chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures,
and more than enough furniture, were left in his possession.
There was, however, no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.
Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour
that the whole household was being distributed free spread
like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with
people who had no business there, but could not be kept out.
Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some
people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others
tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them, or
with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. The road
to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.
In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses
arrived. Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend
Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When Otho
loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.
‘He is indisposed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’
‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see
him and we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!’
Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time
to discover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve
their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study.
Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of
him. He looked indisposed – to see Sackville-Bagginses at
any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his
pocket. But he spoke quite politely.
The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began
by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for
various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied
that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being
given away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.
‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that
you are doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing
the will.’
a long-expected party 51
Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption
of Frodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was,
unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to the legal
customs of hobbits, which demand among other things seven
signatures of witnesses in red ink).
‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting sixty
years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his fingers under
Frodo’s nose and stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily
got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see
how things were going on, and found her still about the place,
investigating nooks and corners, and tapping the floors. He
escorted her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved
her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had
somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she
was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting
remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step,
was:
‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go
too? You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re
a Brandybuck!’
‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’
said Frodo as he shut the door on her.
‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of
course, not true.’
Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young
hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes
in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with
young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson),
who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he
thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo’s gold excited
both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously
obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows,
anyone’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out,
Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to close the
shop, Merry,’ he said. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to
52 the fellowship of the ring
anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then
he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.
He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at
the front-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She
must have thought of something really nasty, and have come
back again to say it. It can wait.’
He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much
louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head
appeared at the window.
‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right
down your hole and out through the hill,’ he said.
‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running
out of the room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it
was Lobelia.’
‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving
a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have
curdled new milk.’
‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly
tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’
‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful
of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have
come to say a last word.’
‘Well, what about it?’
‘What do you know already?’
‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he
found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’
‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.
‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,’
said Frodo. ‘He told me the true story soon after I came
to live here. He said you had pestered him till he told
you, so I had better know too. ‘‘No secrets between us,
Frodo,’’ he said; ‘‘but they are not to go any further. It’s mine
anyway.’’ ’
‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think
of it all?’
‘If you mean, inventing all that about a ‘‘present’’, well, I
thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see
a long-expected party 53
the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do
so, anyway; and I thought it rather odd.’
‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have
such treasures – if they use them. Let it be a warning to you
to be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just
making you vanish when you wish to.’
‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.
‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun
to wonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need
to worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very
seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it in any
way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep
it safe, and keep it secret!’
‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of ?’
‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to
tell you something when I come back. I am going off at once:
so this is good-bye for the present.’ He got up.
‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying
on for at least a week. I was looking forward to your help.’
‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may
be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as
soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in
quietly. I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I
find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a
nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you
want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you
and me to get hold of his wealth.’
‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and
Lobelia. How abominable! I would give them Bag End and
everything else, if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping
in the country with him. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish,
somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see
him again.’
‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many other things.
Good-bye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me,
especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!’
54 the fellowship of the ring
Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his
hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought
the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was
carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, and his
cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did
not see him again for a long time.
