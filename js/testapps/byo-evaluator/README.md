# Writing your own evaluator

This sample demonstrates how to write your own suite of custom evaluators. The evaluators in this package demonstrate how to write evaluators that leverage LLMs as well as a simple regex matcher. There are also simple test datasets to demonstrate how to use them.

## The Bring Your Own (BYO) Evaluator Plugin

To use a new evaluator, you need to define an evaluator plugin that is registered with genkit. We define this as a function `byoEval` in `src/index.ts`.

## Non LLM Evaluators

### Regex

Location: `src/regex`
Name: `byo/regex_match_{name}`
Output: numeric

The regex evaluator is an example that does not use an LLM. It also demonstrates how to create a factory method that can be parameterized.

## LLM Evaluators

### PII Detection

Location: `src/pii`
Name: `byo/pii_detection`
Output: boolean

An evaluator that attempts to detect PII in your output.

### Funniness

Location: `src/funniness`
Name: `byo/funniness`
Output: enum/categorization (FUNNY_JOKE, NOT_FUNNY_JOKE, OFFENSIVE_JOKE, NOT_A_JOKE)

An evaluator that attempts to judge if a passed statement is a joke and if it is funny.

### Deliciousness

Location: `src/deliciousness`
Name: `byo/deliciousness`
Output: string (yes, no, maybe)

An evaluator that attempts to judge if a passed statement is delicious literally or metaphorically.

## Build It

```
pnpm build
```

or if you need to, build everything:

```
cd ../../../; pnpm build; pnpm pack:all; cd -
```

## Test your evaluator

Regex:

```
genkit eval:run datasets/regex_dataset.json --evaluators=byo/regex_match_url,byo/regex_match_us_phone
```

PII Detection:

```
genkit eval:run ./datasets/pii_detection_dataset.json --evaluators=byo/pii_detection
```

Funniness:

```
genkit eval:run datasets/funniness_dataset.json --evaluators=byo/funniness
```

Deliciousness:

```
genkit eval:run datasets/deliciousness_dataset.json --evaluators=byo/deliciousness
```

## See your results

```
genkit start
```

Navigate to the `Evaluate` page
