Title: What is Agentic AI? Important For GEN AI In 2025
Description: Agentic AI, or AI agents, are software systems that can perform tasks autonomously with minimal human intervention. They are designed to be goal-oriented and can interact with data and tools to accomplish tasks. Agentic AI is considered the third wave of artificial intelligence, and it represents a fundamental shift in how people think about and interact with AI.

Title: Andrew Ng Explores The Rise Of AI Agents And Agentic Reasoning | BUILD 2024 Keynote
Description: In recent years, the spotlight in AI has primarily been on large language models (LLMs) and emerging large multi-modal models (LMMs). Now, building on these tools, a new paradigm is emerging with the rise of AI agents and agentic reasoning, which are proving to be both cost-effective and powerful for building numerous new applications. As AI continues to evolve, data across all industries‚Äîparticularly unstructured data such as text, images, video, and audio‚Äîis becoming more critical than ever. In this keynote session from BUILD 2024, Andrews Ng, Founder and Executive Chairman of Landing AI, explores the rise of AI, agents, and the growing role of unstructured data. He also discusses how this convergence will shape automation and application building across industries. Check out Andrew Ng on AI agentic workflows and their potential for driving AI progress here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1XFm21I-VQ

Title: Generative AI is just the Beginning AI Agents are what Comes next | Daoud Abdel Hadi | TEDxPSUT
Description: Navigate the frontier of artificial intelligence, exploring the transformative potential of generative AI and the emerging era of AI agents. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at EastNets, where I'm responsible for introducing and implementing machine learning to tackle the not-so-easy task of combatting financial crimes such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. 

I graduated with both a Bachelors and Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence where I fully immersed myself in all things machine learning, from decision trees to state-of-the-art Deep Neural networks. 

I like being able to explain things and dislike being unable to explain something. This is where my field and I fit together perfectly, I get to think of creative and innovative ways to make sense of data for a living and make something useful out of it. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
